## TL;DR:

Study all nine subjects below, in roughly the presented order, using either the suggested textbook or video lecture series, but ideally both. Aim for 100-200 hours of study of each topic, then revisit favorites throughout your career üöÄ.

| [Computer Architecture](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#architecture)        | If you don‚Äôt have a solid mental model of how a computer actually works, all of your higher-level abstractions will be brittle.                  | _Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective_              | Berkeley CS¬†61C                   |

| [Math for CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#math)                          | CS is basically a runaway branch of applied math, so learning math will give you a competitive advantage.                                        | _Mathematics for Computer Science_                          | Tom Leighton‚Äôs MIT 6.042J         |
| [Operating Systems](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#operating-systems)       | Most of the code you write is run by an operating system, so you should know how those interact.                                                 | _Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces_                      | Berkeley CS¬†162                   |
| [Computer Networking](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#networking)            | The Internet turned out to be a big deal: understand how it works to unlock its full potential.                                                  | _Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach_                  | Stanford CS¬†144                   |
| [Databases](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#databases)                       | Data is at the heart of most significant programs, but few understand how database systems actually work.                                        | _Readings in Database Systems_                              | Joe Hellerstein‚Äôs Berkeley CS¬†186 |
| [Languages and Compilers](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#languages)         | If you understand how languages and compilers actually work, you‚Äôll write better code and learn new languages more easily.                       | _Crafting Interpreters_                                     | Alex Aiken‚Äôs course on edX        |
