# Terraform: Infrastructure as Code 
## IaC Tools Landscape

---
# Evolution of Management IaC

- Manual(documentation?)
- Scripts
- Scripts of Scripts: 
- CMS (Configuration Management Software)
- Infrastructure as code
  - Chef (Ruby)
  - Puppet (Clojure, Ruby)
  - SaltStack (Python)
  - CFEngine (C)
  - Ansible Tower (Python)
  - Terraform (Go)
- Immutable Infrastructure

----
# Types of approaches

- **declarative** (functional): you specify the desired final state of the infrastructure you want to provision and the IaC software handles the rest
- **imperative** (procedural): helps you prepare automation scripts that provision your infrastructure

---
# Methods of Delivery

Two methods of Delivery
- **push**: the server to be configured will pull its configuration from the controlling server
- **pull**: the controlling server pushes the configuration to the destination system

# Terraformer

A CLI tool that generates tf/json and tfstate files based on existing infrastructure (reverse Terraform)

```
$ terraformer import aws --resources=vpc,subnet
2020/05/02 20:56:49 aws importing default region
2020/05/02 20:56:49 aws importing... vpc
2020/05/02 20:56:56 Refreshing state... aws_vpc.tfer--vpc-002D-505d8d3b
2020/05/02 20:57:05 aws importing... subnet
2020/05/02 20:57:12 Refreshing state... aws_subnet.tfer--subnet-002D-d1bc47ba
2020/05/02 20:57:12 Refreshing state... aws_subnet.tfer--subnet-002D-0e487974
2020/05/02 20:57:12 Refreshing state... aws_subnet.tfer--subnet-002D-46a0390a
2020/05/02 20:57:19 aws Connecting.... 
2020/05/02 20:57:19 aws save vpc
2020/05/02 20:57:19 aws save tfstate for vpc
2020/05/02 20:57:19 aws save subnet
2020/05/02 20:57:19 aws save tfstate for subnet
```

# Terraformer

```
$ cat generated/aws/subnet/variables.tf 
data "terraform_remote_state" "vpc" {
  backend = "local"

  config = {
    path = "../../../generated/aws/vpc/terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
$ cat generated/aws/subnet/subnet.tf 
resource "aws_subnet" "tfer--subnet-002D-0e487974" {
  assign_ipv6_address_on_creation = "false"
  cidr_block                      = "172.31.16.0/20"
  map_public_ip_on_launch         = "true"
  vpc_id                          = "${data.terraform_remote_state.vpc.outputs.aws_vpc_tfer--vpc-002D-505d8d3b_id}"

# HashiCorp Suite

### Find the odd one

![height:300px](images/terraform_hashicorp_suite.webp)

---
# HashiCorp Suite

- Vagrant is written in Ruby, uses extremely feature rich DSL
- All others are written in Go, uses HCL
- HCL is not a format for serializing data structures(like JSON, YAML, etc). HCL is a syntax and API for building structured configuration formats
- HCL attempts to strike a compromise between generic serialization formats such as YAML and configuration formats built around full programming languages such as Ruby


---
# Terragrunt

- Keep your Terraform code DRY(remote source)
- Keep your remote state configuration DRY(support expressions, variables and functions)
- Keep your CLI flags DRY(extra CLI arguments)
- Execute Terraform commands on multiple modules at once(run terragrunt once)
- Work with multiple AWS accounts(assume an IAM role)
- Inputs(inputs block)
- Locals
- Before and After Hooks(actions that will be called either before or after execution)
- ...

# Blast Radius

[28mm/blast-radius: Interactive visualizations of Terraform dependency graphs using d3.js](https://github.com/28mm/blast-radius)
![height:450px](images/terraform_blast_radius.png)

_Blast Radius_ is a tool for reasoning about [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) dependency graphs with interactive visualizations.

Use _Blast Radius_ to:

* **Learn** about _Terraform_ or one of its providers through real [examples](https://28mm.github.io/blast-radius-docs/)
* **Document** your infrastructure
* **Reason** about relationships between resources and evaluate changes to them
* **Interact** with the diagram below (and many others) [in the docs](https://28mm.github.io/blast-radius-docs/)
